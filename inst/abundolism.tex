  strong negative relation between the geographical ranges of

  broad geographical ranges also tend to damp speciation rates''
  analysis of modern only might not reveal this pattern---why
  Hawawi\textquotesingle i could be a good place to look
\item
  Krug et al. (2008): uses spp:gen ratio. widespread bival genera have
  more species. ``Species within these cosmopolitan genera may have
  life-history traits or other attributes that allow for rapid
  adaptation to new environments, promoting both speciation and range
  expansion of a lineage''

  Birand et al. (2012): ABM, but about range and pixles are agents.

\item
  Hay et al. (2022): Provides good background on range size +/- corr
  with speciation. ``Honeyeater speciation rate differs considerably
  between islands and the continental setting across the clade's
  distribution, with range size contributing positively in the
  continental setting, while dispersal ability influences speciation
  regardless of setting. These outcomes support Darwin's original
  proposal for a positive relationship between range size and speciation
  likelihood, while extending the evidence for the contribution of
  dispersal ability to speciation.''

  islands good for studying speciation
\item

\item
  Ciccheto et al. (2024): model shows intermediate dispersal is optimum
  for diversification
\item
  Casey et al. (2021): extinction up with decreasing abundance (range

\item
  Claramunt et al. (2025): ``we found mixed evidence for the effect of
  dispersal on diversification rates: dispersive lineages show either
  slightly higher speciation rates or higher extinction rates. Our
  results therefore suggest that high dispersal ability increases range
  expansion and turnover, perhaps because dispersive lineages expand
  into islands or other geographically restricted environments and have
  lower population sizes\ldots even though per capita dispersal rates
  may be high for highly dispersive species, levels of gene flow may be
  relatively low due to lower population size. This effect may explain
  why population genetic studies have not consistently found the
  expected negative relationship between dispersal ability and genetic
  differentiation71,72,73 and why rates of speciation remain relatively
  stable across a wide range of dispersal capabilities''

\subsection{Methods}\label{methods}

\subsubsection{Simulating a birth-death-immigration process with
speciation}\label{simulating-a-birth-death-immigration-process-with-speciation}

We simulate a birth-death-immigration process (BDI) with speciation
(BDIS) in a modified metapopulation (Hanski 1998) setting. In this
setting there are a number of local populations connected by dispersal
as well as an global source pool connected to each local population by
dispersal. The global source pool is considered extremely large relative
to local populations such that extinction of the global source pool is
unlikely on the time scale of local dynamics (we approximate this
assumption by never allowing the source pool to go extinct). Local
populations grow and shrink according to local births and deaths,
dispersal between local populations, and dispersal from the source pool.
New species arise via a modified protracted speciation process
(Rosindell et al. 2010) similar to the model of Tao et al. (2021). Our
simulation model is consistent with other models derived from the
Unified Neutral Theory of Biodiversity {[}UNTB; Hubbell (2001){]}, but
unlike those models' multi-species perspectives, we only concern
ourselves with a single species and whether that one species undergoes a
speciation event. In that way we do not in fact make the assumption of
per capita neutrality across species, meaning our results could be
generalization to multi-species eco-evolutionary models based on niche
theories (\textbf{niche-stuff?}).

Our simulation proceeds according to these rules:

\begin{enumerate}
\def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
\tightlist
\item
  Birth, death, immigration, and speciation all happen independently and
  are determined by their own respective rates
\item
  Speciation has 2 steps:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumii{\roman{enumii}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    incipient speciation happens by turning one local population into an
    incipient new species
  \item
    if the incipient species lasts long enough it becomes a new species;
    ``long engough'' is determined by a waiting time parameter
    \(\tau\)---the larger \(\tau\), the longer an incipient species must
    wait before becoming a genuinely new species
  \end{enumerate}
\item
  Immigration between local communities and from the global source pool
  slows the progress toward speciation; if an incipient species has to
  wait \(\tau\) time (in the absence of immigration) until it is a full
  species, each immigration event adds an increment to \(\tau\) of
  \(\xi / n_i\) where \(\xi\) is a parameter we can set and \(n_i\) is
  the population size of the incipient species
\item
  Once full speciation occurs the simulation is stopped; if the
  simulation reaches the maximum designated number of iterations without
  full speciation, then the simulation stops anyway
\end{enumerate}

These processes are governed by the following parameters:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(\lambda\) (\texttt{la}): local birth rate
\item
  \(\mu\) (\texttt{mu}): local death rate
\item
  \(\gamma\) (\texttt{g}): dispersal rate from the global source pool to
  one local population
\item
  \(m_p\) (\texttt{m\_prop}): proportional dispersal rate between local
  populations relative to global rate; immigration rate
  \(m = \gamma \times m_p\)
\item
  \(\nu\) (\texttt{nu}): incipient speciation rate
\item
  \(\tau\) (\texttt{tau}): wait time to full speciation in the absence
  of dispersal
\item
  \(\xi\) (\texttt{xi}): amount each dispersal event sets back the
  progression toward speciation
\item
  \(n_p\) (\texttt{np}): number of local populations
\item
  \(n_\text{step}\) (\texttt{nstep}): number of iterations to run the
  simulation for
\end{itemize}

Full details of the simulation are provided in \ssec{sec-sim}.
Underlying C++ and R source code is available in the R package
\emph{abondolism} (Rominger 2026) accompanying this paper.

So we see there is a sweet spot of intermediate abundance where
speciation is most likely to take place!
